    <h1>Histroy of Computer</h1>
    <hr>
    <br>
    <p>The first counting device was used by the primitive people. They used sticks, stones and bones as counting tools. As human mind and technology improved with time more computing devices were developed.</p>
    <h2>Computer in 1800s</h2>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p><em>801: In France, weaver and merchant </em>Joseph Marie Jacquard creates a loom that uses wooden punch cards to automate the design of woven fabrics. Early computers would use similar punch cards.

        <em> 1822: </em>Thanks to funding from the English government, mathematician Charles Babbage invents a steam-driven calculating machine that was able to compute tables of numbers.
        
        1890: Inventor Herman Hollerith designs the punch card system to calculate the 1880 U.S. census. It took him three years to create, and it saved the government $5 million. He would eventually go on to establish a company that would become IBM.</p>
